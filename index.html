          <h3> What <em>is</em> coffee? </h3>
            <p>
              Coffee in the everyday sense is a beverage brewed from coffee beans, and is prepared in several different ways.
              Some people prefer it plain black, while others prefer to add milk, cream, sugar, spices, and several other additions.
              
              However, the National Coffee Association, defines coffee as the berries harvested from the Caffea plant.

          <h4>Origins</h4>
            <p>
                The when and how coffee was discovered is largely unknown. Several stories and legends 
              exist to explain its origins. One thing that is for certain, is all coffee grown around the globe can be traced
              back to modern-day Ethiopia. There is a legend that around the third centurey AD, a goat shepherd noticed the change in behavior of his
              goats after consuming coffee berries. During the 15th century, knowledge of the energizing "berries" spread from 
              Ethiopia to the Arabian peninsula, where coffee cultivation, the coffee trade and human caffeination grew immensely.
              
                Speaking of caffeination, the energizing properties of coffee are due to a special organic molecule named <em>caffeine</em>.
              As a stimulant, caffeine acts on the Central Nervous System which affects a person's cognitive function.

          <h5>The Coffea plant</h5>
          <p>
            Most of us may recognize a roasted coffee bean, but we may be unfamiliar with the actual plant itself!

            Coffee comes from the berries of Coffea plants.
