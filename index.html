            <p>
              Coffee in the everyday sense is a beverage brewed from coffee beans, and normally prepared either iced or hot. Some people prefer it black, while others prefer to add milk, cream, or sugar.
              
              However, the National Coffee Association, defines coffee as the berries harvested from the Caffea plant.

              Ethiopia to the Arabian peninsula, where coffee cultivation, the coffee trade and caffeination.
