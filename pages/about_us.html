                                I'm from South Florida, and I live near Miami (it's so hot out here) with my husband and daughter.
                                <br>A bit about me, I am Mexican American and I speak English and Spanish. 
                                In my free time, I like to exercise, walk outdoors, and hang out with my family. 
                                I also love to cook but I wish I had more time to try delicious recipes!
